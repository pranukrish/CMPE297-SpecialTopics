Implemented the below three deep learning models using Github Copilot Chat
1. MNIST dataset Classification
2. Text Sentiment Analysis on IMDB reviews dataset
3. Image Classification for MNIST_fashion dataset

The prompts that I have used are as below
Write a deep neural network in keras to classify MNIST dataset. Also take some example inputs and show results
Implement a deep learning model for Text Sentiment Analysis with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for IMDB movie reviews
Build a deep learning model for Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for the MNIST fashion dataset
